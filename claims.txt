- The Assembler
	- The assembler submitted parses the source file once, during which it updates a table of symbol (label) names and values.
	- The assembler diagnoses the following label errors:
		- Duplicate labels
		- Undefined labels
		- Unused labels (warning)
	- The assembler produces an advanced listing file.
	- The assembler's source file makes use of a table of instruction names and expected operands.
	- The assembler assembles the valid test programs test1.asm, test2.asm, test3.asm, test4.asm, and test5.asm.
	- The assembler diagnoses the errors in the erraneous test program test6.asm.
	- The assembler implements the 'SET' instruction, whose use is demonstrated in the program test5.asm.

- The Bubble-Sort Program
	- The bubble-sort program bubble.asm assembles.
	- The bubble-sort program bubble.asm works.

- The Emulator
	- The emulator loads object files.
	- The emulator produces a memory dump with the '-before' and '-after' options.
	- The emulator executes the valid test programs.
	- The emulator detects malformed object files.

 - Test Cases
 	- In addition to the bubble-sort program, the following test programs (and their respective log, listing, and object files) are provided:
		- test1.asm (Fibonacci)
		- test2.asm (factorial)
		- test3.asm (division)
		- test4.asm (array sum)
		- test5.asm (SET example)
		- test6.asm (failure example)
