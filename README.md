# The SIMPLE Assembly Instruction Set

This repository includes implementations of an assembler and an emulator for the SIMPLE assembly instruction set (described in CS2102_Project2024.pdf), as part of a mini-project for the CS2102 course on Digital Logic and Computer Organization.

## Build Instructions

```
$ cc -std=c11 asm.c -o asm
$ cc -std=c11 emu.c -o emu
```

## Samples and Tests

Also included are the (course provided) sample assembler and emulator Linux executables (in sample/), as well as test assembly programs (in tests/).
